Hello everyone! My name is Olya and I’m 18 years old. I’m a Fronted manager of our group! An interesting fact about me is that I own 3 horses and one pony back home. Two of them are purple. Also, I can fly a helicopter. What about you?


Hi! My name is Aima Katt and I am really good at playing the keyboard. My person says that I am the best keyboardist in the whole house!! This is a picture of me, aren’t I cute? I play best after having naps in the spots in the house where the sun shines.
